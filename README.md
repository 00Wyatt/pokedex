# Pokédex

A responsive Pokédex app built with React, styled using TailwindCSS, and bundled with Vite. The app fetches data from the Pokémon API.

This project showcases modern front-end development practices and API integration, using React for dynamic UI updates and TailwindCSS for efficient styling. Also included is theme toggling from light to dark, and data caching using local storage to minimise API requests.

The user can browse the list of Pokémon or search for one by name or Pokédex number. The page displays information about the selected Pokémon including their weight, height, abilities, stats, and a full list of the moves they can learn.
